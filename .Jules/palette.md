## 2026-01-16 - Documentation as the First UX Interaction
**Learning:** Even with a good CLI tool, the entry barrier is high if the landing page (`index.rst`) is generic. Users shouldn't have to dig into "User Guide" to find the "how to install" or "what does this do" commands.
**Action:** Always surface "Quick Start" (install + 1st command) and "Key Features" directly on the landing page of Sphinx documentation. It acts as the "Home" screen of the application.
